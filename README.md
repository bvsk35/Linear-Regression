## Linear Regression using Gradient Descent and Newton's Method
##### Author & Date: Sameer Kumar, 12/09/2018
- In this repo I have implemented a Gradient Descent and Newton's Method on a Linear Regression problem.
- I have implemented Batch and Online Gradient Descent. Since the nature of the linear regression problem is quadratic, it will converge to solution in one step for Newton's Method (but the code will take more than one step because rounding of error). Hence for Newton's Method it doesn't matter if it is Online or Batch Learning.
- I have also calculated Pseduo Inverse Solution i.e. Closed Form Solution of the Linear Regression Problem.
- Note: I have also attached results.
