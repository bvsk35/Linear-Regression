## Linear Regression using Gradient Descent and Newton's Method
##### Author & Date: Sameer Kumar, 12/09/2018
- In this repo I have implemented a Gradient Descent and Newton's Method on a Linear Regression problem.
- I have implemented Batch and Online Gradient Descent. And for a linear regression problem since the nature of the problem is quadratic, it will converge to solution in one step (but the code will take more than one step because of the numerical stability of the code). Hence for Newton's Method it doesn't matter if it is Online or Batch Learning.
- I have also calculated Pseduo Inverse Solution i.e. Closed Form Solution of the Linear Regression Problem.
- Note: I have also attached results.
